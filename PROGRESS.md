# PROGRESS.md

Running log of work across sessions on `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync`, to allow any
session (human or agent) to pick up where the last one left off. Update this file at the
end of a substantial work session — append, don't rewrite history.

Read this alongside `CLAUDE.md` at session start.

## Standing rule: `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync` is the production-tracking branch, not `main`

**This is a durable operating rule, not a session note — follow it every session until this
section says otherwise.**

`main` on GitHub is stale by design in this repo. The 2026-07-09/07-11 session (see below)
discovered production was running a mix of Docker images built from different divergent
branches, root-caused it, and fully merged `feat/production-deployment-hardening` (111 commits)
and `feat/support-staff-shift-routing` (3 commits) into `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync`. At
that point all three known branches — `main` and both of the above — had **zero commits missing**
from `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync`, and production was rebuilt from that branch's tip.
`feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync` is therefore a strict superset of `main`, not a fork that needs
reconciling with it.

**How to apply:**
- Cut new feature branches from `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync`, never from `main`:
  `git checkout feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync && git pull && git checkout -b <new-branch>`.
- Do not merge feature work into `main`, and do not attempt to "sync" `main` up to date as a
  side effect of unrelated work — that is a deliberate, separate decision requiring Kes's
  explicit approval, not a default action.
- `main` being the GitHub-default / PR-target branch label is a repo-settings artifact, not a
  signal about where production code lives. Don't infer branch choice from that label alone.

**How to verify this is still true (run before trusting the above, especially if it's been a
while since the last session):**
```
git fetch origin
git log feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync..main --oneline
git log feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync..feat/production-deployment-hardening --oneline
git log feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync..feat/support-staff-shift-routing --oneline
```
All three must return **empty**. A non-empty result means one of those branches has commits
`feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync` doesn't have — the invariant has broken (someone committed
directly to `main` or another branch, bypassing this one) and needs investigating before
building anything new. If it breaks, update this section with what happened and the new state —
don't just silently re-fix it and move on.

Confirm production actually matches this branch's tip before relying on any of the above as
current fact: `docker compose images` on the Hetzner box should show all services built from the
same recent timestamp/commit. Git branch topology alone doesn't prove the running containers
match — Docker images can lag behind the branch.

## Session: 2026-07-17 — Cold Lead 404 alert triage, Cold-Lead-only pause control, branch-drift check

**Branch**: `feat/cold-lead-campaign-pause` (cut from `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync`)

### What happened

Kes brought five `Synthflow launch HTTP error: 404` alerts (contacts +19592022210 ×2,
+15714782790, +16127301379, +18084292459; 2026-07-15 22:00 UTC through 2026-07-17 15:46 UTC).
Queried `scheduled_jobs` for the five `job_id`s — all five are **Cold Lead** campaign, all
`status='failed'`.

1. **Built a `cold_lead_campaign_paused` mode flag**, scoped narrower than the existing
   `outbound_campaigns_paused` (which holds New Lead + Cold Lead together). Mirrors the existing
   flag's pattern at every check site: `app/core/mode_flags.py`, `app/core/campaigns.py`
   (`enter_campaign`), `app/worker/jobs/{outbound,voicemail,crm,ai,channel}_jobs.py`,
   `app/worker/jobs/nurture_scheduler.py`, new dashboard endpoints
   (`/mode/pause-cold-lead-campaign`, `/mode/resume-cold-lead-campaign`), and a new "Cold Lead
   Campaign Pause" section in `SystemControlsClient.tsx`. New tests in `test_campaigns.py` and
   `test_outbound_jobs.py` cover Cold-Lead-skipped / New-Lead-unaffected in both the entry point
   and the job-execution guard. Full unit suite run (`--ignore=test_e2e_scenarios.py`): no new
   failures, confirmed via `git stash` diff against the pre-change baseline (all 46 pre-existing
   failures are environment gaps — missing `openai` package, no local Redis/tables — unrelated to
   this branch). **As of this entry: implemented and tested locally, not yet committed.**

2. **Mid-session branch-drift scare, resolved**: initially cut this branch from `main`, then
   discovered `main` was missing `outbound_campaigns_paused` and the whole pause mechanism
   entirely — 138 commits behind. Re-cut from `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync` instead. Root
   cause and the durable fix (cut from the sync branch, always) is now written up as the standing
   rule above so this doesn't recur.

3. **Confirmed root cause of the timing, via `app_config`/`audit_log` on Hetzner:** the 2026-07-11
   session recorded production as `shadow_mode_enabled=true` and `outbound_campaigns_paused=true`
   at that time, and explicitly listed "the Synthflow Cold Lead webhook is stale/broken and needs
   checking before live calling resumes" as a known, unresolved blocker. Confirmed:
   `shadow_mode_enabled` flipped `true → false` at **2026-07-15 21:44:41 UTC**
   (`app_config.updated_by = 'dashboard'` — generic fallback operator ID, see note below). The
   first two Cold Lead 404s in today's alert set fired at **22:00:50 UTC the same day — 16 minutes
   later**. So: someone took the system live without the webhook fix happening first, and it broke
   almost immediately. It ran live and broken for Cold Lead for **2 days** before these alerts were
   brought to this session. `outbound_campaigns_paused` itself was never re-enabled after 07-11
   (confirmed unrelated to this flip); `shadow_mode_enabled` was the only lever that changed.
   **Audit trail gap**: `updated_by='dashboard'` is `SystemControlsClient.tsx`'s generic fallback
   when no operator has set an `operator_id` in their browser's `localStorage` — there is currently
   no way to tell *who* flipped this from the DB alone. Not fixed this session; flagging as a real
   gap if attribution ever matters (e.g. after an incident like this one).
   **As of this entry, `shadow_mode_enabled` remains `false` (live)** — New Lead and any SMS/email
   campaigns have been making real contact with real leads for 2 days with no reported issues.
   This has not been independently reviewed as an intended state versus an unannounced side effect
   of whatever prompted the 07-15 flip — worth a deliberate decision, not just inertia.

### Root cause vs. the fix built this session — do not conflate these

- **Actual root cause of the 404s** (per the 07-11 session, still unresolved): the Cold Lead
  Synthflow "Make Call" webhook is stale/broken in **Synthflow's own dashboard** — not a bug in
  this repo. Fixing it requires action in Synthflow's UI, outside this codebase.
- **What this session built**: a Cold-Lead-only pause toggle. This is an operational safety net
  (hold Cold Lead without also holding New Lead) — it does **not** fix the webhook. Calls will
  404 again the moment Cold Lead is unpaused until the Synthflow-side fix happens.

### Update — same session, after Kes tested on Hetzner

Kes deployed `feat/cold-lead-campaign-pause` to Hetzner (`git pull` + `docker compose up -d
--build`), toggled "Pause Cold Lead Campaign" in the dashboard, and confirmed it works — shown as
"Cold Lead Campaign Paused" with a working "Resume" button. Merged into
`feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync` (fast-forward, `d9d94aa..f09ce52`, no PR needed — see the new
Branching Model section in `CLAUDE.md`) and pushed. **Hetzner is still running the
`feat/cold-lead-campaign-pause` checkout, not the merged `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync` tip —
functionally identical (fast-forward, same commit), but the next session should `git checkout
feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync` there to keep the branch label consistent with what's documented
as the production-tracking branch.**

Also added a permanent "Branching Model" section to `CLAUDE.md` (cutting/merging procedure,
verification commands) so this doesn't need re-explaining every session — the standing rule below
now has a companion procedure doc.

### Update — same session, shadow-mode flip explained + New Lead verified healthy

Kes confirmed the 07-15 21:44 UTC `shadow_mode_enabled` flip was **intentional** — done so New
Lead campaigns could start working live. At the time, no granular per-campaign control existed
(`cold_lead_campaign_paused` didn't exist until this session), and `outbound_campaigns_paused`
holds New Lead + Cold Lead together — so there was no way to bring New Lead live without also
exposing Cold Lead's already-known-broken webhook as an unavoidable side effect. The real gap
was that the 07-11 session's explicit note — "webhook needs checking before live calling
resumes" — wasn't checked first. Not a tooling failure at the time; today's `cold_lead_campaign_paused`
flag exists specifically so this choice doesn't have to be all-or-nothing again.

Verified New Lead is genuinely healthy, not just quiet: `call_events` for the last 2 days shows 6
completed, 4 hangup_on_voicemail, 1 no-answer, 1 failed (12 total) — a normal outbound-calling
outcome mix. Unlike Cold Lead's 404s (which fail *before* Synthflow ever creates a call, so no
`call_events` row exists for those attempts), New Lead calls are reaching Synthflow and being
answered/not-answered normally. The single "failed" row is a call-level outcome, not a launch
failure — not concerning at this volume.

**Decision:** leave `shadow_mode_enabled=false` (live) as-is — it was intentional and New Lead is
confirmed working. `cold_lead_campaign_paused=true` stays on until the webhook is fixed.

### Next steps, in order

1. Kes to check/fix the Cold Lead "Make Call" workflow webhook in Synthflow's dashboard —
   carried over from the 07-11 session, still not done. The pause toggle is a stopgap, not the
   fix. Required before Cold Lead can be safely un-paused.
2. Optional cleanup: switch Hetzner's git checkout from `feat/cold-lead-campaign-pause` to
   `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync` (same commit, just a label mismatch).
3. Consider whether `operator_id` should be required (not defaulting to `'dashboard'`) for
   mode-flag changes, given the audit-trail gap surfaced this session.
4. Everything carried over from the 2026-07-15 session below is still open and untouched by this
   session.

## Session: 2026-07-15 — Synthflow voice-agent routing swap, DNC gap analysis, new-lead trigger source identified

**Branch**: `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync`

### What changed

1. **New Lead campaign's Synthflow assistant repointed to Cold Lead's, live in production.**
   The New Lead agent's own phone number was lost. Kes fixed it directly in Synthflow's
   dashboard (not in this repo) by changing the New Lead "Make Call" workflow
   (`p6ihFj7HmplXM2WiuVsaC`)'s Assistant field from its own agent to "Cora - Outbound
   Admissions Agent - ColdL" (model_id `95fd0659-7446-423c-bc51-764c3060c90f`). Confirmed live
   via a `call_events` cross-tab query: New Lead calls flipped from the old model_id
   (`2608601d-...`, last seen 16:06 UTC) to the Cold Lead model_id (first seen 22:00 UTC) on
   2026-07-15. Updated the stale mapping comment in `app/adapters/synthflow.py` to match.
   Important: `CallEvent.voice_agent` labeling (`ColdLead`/`NewLead`/`Inbound`) comes from the
   Synthflow workflow's own `Agent` text field, not the model_id — so New Lead calls still
   correctly label as `NewLead` in the dashboard despite sharing an assistant with Cold Lead.
   The old New Lead assistant now has no phone number and isn't wired to any workflow —
   **not yet decided** whether to retire it or re-provision a number.

### Findings — not yet acted on, need a decision

2. **`launch_outbound_call_job` never checks `lead_state.do_not_call` before dialing.**
   (`app/worker/jobs/outbound_jobs.py`) It checks `system_paused`, `outbound_campaigns_paused`,
   the static `blocked_dial_numbers` list, and the campaign active window — but not the DNC
   flag itself. In normal operation this is masked because `handle_intent` cancels pending jobs
   when `do_not_call` fires, but there's no belt-and-suspenders check at the actual dial point,
   so a stale/re-scheduled job could still call a DNC-flagged contact. Small, low-risk fix,
   proposed but not built.

3. **Cora never ingests GHL's own DNC-style tags.** `lead_state.do_not_call` is only ever set
   from Cora's own live intent detection — there's no sync pulling in pre-existing GHL tags
   like `do not contact` / `do not call again` / `spam likely`. Surfaced by a real inbound call
   (`call_id c9620c5f...`, contact `+19729921028`) where GHL already had this contact tagged
   do-not-contact from a stale 2025 interaction (an unrelated caller from "Pulte Mortgage"), but
   Cora's Inbound agent still delivered a full personalized re-engagement pitch. Needs a spec
   (which GHL tags count as DNC-equivalent, live check vs. periodic sync) before building.

4. **Inbound agent doesn't act on GHL tags it already fetches.** The Synthflow Inbound workflow
   calls a custom function (`get_the_user_preferences_from_gohighlevel`) that returns the GHL
   contact including tags, but the assistant's prompt doesn't branch on do-not-contact tags —
   this is a Synthflow-side prompt/workflow fix, outside this repo's control.

5. **Likely test/QA artifact found in production call data**: an inbound call's
   `phone_number_from` exactly matched a New Lead outbound call's target number placed 32
   seconds earlier (`0d5f0ce1` → `0b453e92`, both 2026-07-15 ~22:41 UTC) — consistent with an
   automated harness that answers Cora's outbound call and immediately rings back into Cora's
   Inbound line. Not confirmed with whoever runs QA; flagged for awareness only.

6. **Signed recording URLs in `call_events.recording_url` have ~100-year expiry**
   (`Expires=4937753238`, i.e. year 2126) — effectively permanent, unauthenticated access to the
   audio for anyone who obtains the URL. Noted as a hygiene concern, not yet addressed.

### Architecture fact confirmed this session (previously undocumented)

7. **The first call to a brand-new "New Lead" is not triggered by any code path in this repo.**
   Checked thoroughly: the only inbound API route is `POST /v1/webhooks/calls` (Synthflow
   *completed*-call intake, not a new-lead notification), there is no polling job that discovers
   new leads, and `enter_campaign(session, lead, "new_lead", ...)` is never actually called
   anywhere in the worker/job code (only `"cold_lead"` call sites exist, from
   `intent_actions.py` and `nurture_scheduler.py`). The first dial for a new lead is therefore
   almost certainly triggered externally — most likely a GHL workflow hitting Synthflow's
   "Make Call" webhook directly — and Cora only takes over once that first call's completion
   webhook arrives. Not confirmed against the actual GHL workflow config (inferred from absence
   of any other trigger path in this codebase) — worth verifying with whoever owns that
   automation. If it ever breaks, new leads would silently never enter Cora's pipeline.

### Next steps, in order

1. Decide whether to fix item 2 (outbound `do_not_call` dial-point guard) — small and low-risk,
   ready to build on approval.
2. Spec item 3 (GHL DNC-tag ingestion) before building — needs a decision on tag matching rules
   and sync mechanism.
3. Raise item 4 (Inbound agent prompt gap) with whoever owns the Synthflow Inbound workflow —
   not fixable from this repo.
4. Confirm item 7 (external New Lead trigger source) with whoever owns the GHL workflow that
   presumably fires the first call — currently undocumented outside this session's inference.
5. Decide fate of the old, numberless New Lead Synthflow assistant (retire vs. re-provision).
6. Carried over from the previous session, still open: permanent domain + TLS reverse proxy
   (blocked on Ali's DNS record), real production Colaberry GHL OAuth install, staff portal
   build, app-wide logging gap, pre-existing test failure triage.

## Session: 2026-07-09 to 2026-07-11 — GHL Conversations write-back, branch consolidation, staff portal planning

**Branch**: `feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync`
**Latest commit at end of session**: `e3a32e1` — "Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/feat/support-staff-shift-routing' into feat/ghl-call-conversation-sync"

### What shipped

1. **GHL Marketplace Conversations OAuth write-back** (spec/19, spec/20) — fully working end
   to end against the sandbox, verified with a real API write and a human visual check in the
   GHL UI (Acceptance Criterion 12 passed). Two real bugs found and fixed along the way:
   - `get_location_token()` was missing the required `Version` header on
     `POST /oauth/locationToken` — every real install failed with a 401.
   - GHL Marketplace test installs can land on a different company/agency each session; the
     target-location config has to match whichever company actually authorizes.
   - Full reusable verification procedure documented in spec/20 §9.

2. **Branch consolidation** — discovered production was running a mix of Docker images built
   from different branches/times (different services literally running different code).
   Root-caused and fully merged the two other divergent feature branches into this one:
   - `feat/production-deployment-hardening` (111 commits — webhook recovery, DB Explorer,
     worker activity dashboards, voice performance v2, PgBouncer, stale-lead recovery, slot
     rebalancer, outbound-campaign-pause control, and more).
   - `feat/support-staff-shift-routing` (3 commits — shift-based customer support call-summary
     routing, `app/core/staff_roster.py`).
   - All three known remote branches (`main`, both of the above) now have zero commits missing
     from this branch.
   - Fixed a real gap found during this work: `outbound_campaigns_paused` was checked in six
     worker job files but not in `app/core/campaigns.py`'s `enter_campaign()` or its two direct
     callers in `intent_actions.py` — centralized the check in `enter_campaign()` itself so
     every current and future caller is protected uniformly.
   - Fixed a pre-existing test gap (`test_outbound_jobs.py`'s flag mock missing the new field).
   - Fixed a Synthflow call-status bug: `"user-canceled"` wasn't in `_FAILED_STATUSES`, causing
     it to be misrouted through full AI processing on empty-data calls.

3. **Caught and fixed a live production data leak**: `GHL_OAUTH_TARGET_LOCATION_ID` was left
   pointed at the sandbox location after AC12 testing, causing every real production call's
   `write_conversation_log` job to attempt a write using the sandbox's token against a contact
   that doesn't exist under that authorization — real GHL 401s for about an hour before caught.
   Fixed (commented out in the server's `.env`) and documented in spec/20 §9.4 as a required
   cleanup step after every sandbox verification run.

### Current live production state (Hetzner box, `/opt/cora-recap-engine`)

- All 8 app services rebuilt consistently from this branch's latest commit (confirm with
  `docker compose images` — all should share the same build timestamp).
- `shadow_mode_enabled` = **true** (Shadow) — no real outbound Synthflow calls go out.
- `outbound_campaigns_paused` = **true** — New Lead / Cold Lead campaign activity held.
- `GHL_WRITE_CONVERSATION_LOG` = true, but `GHL_OAUTH_TARGET_LOCATION_ID` is commented out, so
  it correctly falls back to the real production `GHL_LOCATION_ID` (`ttBtJmxoLwjf18lIvvVD`),
  which has no stored OAuth token — writes cleanly no-op (Acceptance Criterion 9), which is the
  safe/correct state until the real production install happens.
- OAuth is installed only for the sandbox location (`eWe9cRDf0UmSSIBxBMAO`) — **not** the real
  Colaberry account yet.
- ngrok is still the OAuth redirect URI (`4654-...ngrok-free.app`) — ephemeral, will need
  re-syncing again if it restarts.

### Explicitly NOT done yet (do not assume otherwise)

- Real OAuth install against the production Colaberry GHL location — blocked on (a) confirming
  billing/plan implications with GHL, (b) a permanent domain (see below).
- GHL Conversations recording attachment and transcript delivery — deferred, spec/20 §7 has the
  full investigation trail (GHL's own upload endpoint's output fails its own validation).
- Fixing the Synthflow Cold Lead webhook 404 (the original alert that kicked off this session's
  investigation) — no longer urgent since shadow mode covers it, but the webhook URL itself is
  still stale/broken in Synthflow's dashboard and needs checking before live calling resumes.
- App-wide `logger.info()` being silently swallowed — `settings.log_level` is only ever wired
  into `uvicorn.run()`'s own logger, never into Python's root logger via `logging.basicConfig()`.
  Non-blocking, but affects observability everywhere, not just this feature.
- Staff portal for admissions/support assistants (see below) — planning only, no code yet.

### Next steps, in order

1. **Waiting on Ali**: DNS A record `cora.colaberry.com → 204.168.245.238`
   (BC ticket [10084773637](https://app.basecamp.com/3945211/buckets/15139308/todos/10084773637)).
2. Once DNS is live: reverse proxy (Caddy recommended — automatic Let's Encrypt) in front of
   `frontend`/`dashboard-api`/`api`, bind those services to `127.0.0.1` only.
3. Update the GHL Marketplace app's Redirect URI to the permanent domain, retire ngrok.
4. Confirm billing/plan implications, then do the real production Colaberry GHL install
   (spec/20 §9 has the exact repeatable procedure).
5. Build the staff portal — decided approach: separate portal (not role-gating the existing
   dashboard, which has no role concept anywhere today), individual accounts (`staff_users`
   table, bcrypt password hashes), Redis-backed sessions with httpOnly secure cookies. Needs
   the domain/TLS from steps 1-2 first — do not build the login flow over plain HTTP.
6. Separate, non-blocking cleanup: the app-wide logging gap (item above), and two clusters of
   pre-existing test failures worth triage — 5 tests in `test_enrolled_intent.py` /
   `test_ghl_adapter.py` / `test_inbound_call_processing.py` (predate this session), and 5
   slot-rebalancer timing tests in `test_outbound_jobs.py` (confirmed pre-existing on
   `feat/production-deployment-hardening` itself via a clean-checkout reproduction, not
   introduced by the branch merge).
